## Learning and Improvements

This project is an excellent way for me to start with Svelte and expand my frontend development skills. I've been able to explore different functionalities, such as state management, events, and components.

## Future Enhancements Planned:

- Field validation in the form.
- UI/UX improvements in design.
- Persistence of generated cards using local storage.
